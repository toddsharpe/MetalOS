Todo List
* Fork orignal doom source code and port to MetalOS
  * Use CPP for port entry points
* Kernel DPCs
* Windowing system
* UserThread shouldn't use a full context structure
* Move loader entirely userside?
* c++ headers like "Thread" or "File" that store the identifying handle and wrap the native interface:

Code cleanup
* Fix/standardize windows headers (WindowsPE->winnt.h)

In Progress:
* extract x64 functionality out to library

class Thread
{
public:
	Thread(Handle thread);

	size_t Suspend()
	{
		return SuspendThread(m_thread);
	}

private:
	Handle m_thread;
}



Done:
* Convert MetalOS header to c++
* Remove .init and just inject a dll with entries
